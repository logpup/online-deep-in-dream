                <span class="imgText linear-wipe">Concerning</span> the two modes of production, culture and technology are seen as opposites the latter considered the predecessor to any developments made in the former. Delineating our history by material composites – stone, bronze, iron and so on – we can consider ourselves currently in the age of silicon. Manufacturing tools that extend the reach of our bones, the strength of our muscles, and the precision of our dactyl appendages, we are now enmeshed in the circuitry, technology electric like our brains as we confront the power of this new cognitive addendum greatly enhancing our abilities in a wide range of our daily experiences. Yet, as it was told that Icarus flew from the sky falling from the heavens attached to practically a defunct parasail eons before its marketplace distribution, fictitious accounts and our imagination can be seen as the true egg before the chicken that urge us to mediate inventions that can satiate our libido. Always hankering for more out of life.

                The internet can be considered a homestead for our desires. Computers and what is expected to come as artificial intelligence advances along with R&D in quantum computing and processing power accelerate exponentially, the future of this technology hosts a wide range of prophecy from a utopic singularity to our existential null. For now, the intersection between computer science and the arts, has been mostly limited to front-end developers employing graphic designers to toggle styles and appropriately structure elements to make this binary realm a more habitable place. The humanities have imagined what might spring in theory but not yet in practice as engineers and scientists have been cogitating laboriously since the 1940’s. Yet machine vision and aesthetic valuators hold promise in their ability to mimic our own empirical methods and ways of judgement possibly to compute a simulation of our own ontology.

                Current capitalist mechanisms, it turned out, were extremely compatible with the wide swarm of digital frameworks. Marketed as a network to bring us closer together with more ease and speed, it has unfortunately oversaturated our attention driving us to make quick associations and reckless decisions inevitably emplacing harsh hierarchies between different categories of people: arbitrary in nature but crucial when in terms of service and capital. Our personhood meanwhile is treated as equally as any other object or digit that the computer may encounter, with no face at all extending the cold attitude of the large corporate giants filing us in and out of highly-controlled arenas projecting their spheres of influence.
                </p>
                <p>
                Not all doom and gloom, this technology has also relied heavily on open-source networks where individual developers without any institutional backing can begin to learn and adapt resources providing service to their own immediate communities. The diffusion of computer know-how yet contrasts with the series of mergers that have taken place since the dot com boom involving large corporate players in the telecommunication, software, and hardware components sectors that has stoked public unease concerning a reification of an archetypal conglomerate pseudo-state.

                So, in the coming years are we still allowed to hope for a disseminating paradigm where groups of individuals catalyze the crumbling of the corporate monopoly on power to birth a techno-socialist paradise? What would it mean if computers were able to analyze art, pay attention to emotions and concern, and understand intuition? Is it possible and what would it say if subjectivity could be objectified? Furthermore, with the onset of aesthetically inclined features interested in how we "feel" using this new technology and not just raw performance, can we expect that same consideration on our own lives? Will corporate logic factor in our week-being? Will computers now get how we feel?

                Like many concepts in western thought, artificial intelligence’s initial instance was voiced by the Classical World in the form of myth and fantasy. The Greeks imagined automata like Talos the giant bronze robot from Crete who protected its inhabitants from foreign intruders: one of the earliest depictions of the great firewall. Daedalus the mystical inventor from the ancient world along with Hephaestus the god of forgery would be the intellectual handymen who crafted living sculptures, intelligent robots, and artificial beings like Pandora in these stories. But these were just stories. Although block-chains might be a third-degree form of transmutation, just like alchemy, artificial intelligence would inhabit the realm of protoscience for most of our human history and remain fanciful stories and the curious musing for the armchair philosopher.

                    There is something Babelic when talking about artificial intelligence, for humans to desire creating life like our maker. Supposedly the eight century Iranian polymath Jābir ibn Hayyān commonly referred to as Geber and the father of chemistry was the first in the Islamic tradition to set the Muslim alchemic goal of Takwin, the drive to create synthetic life. In Jewish Mysticism, during the Talmudic period Kabbalist writers studied the Sefer Yetzirah, the Book of Creation, so to bring rock golems to life by infusing statues with paper written on it the name of God.
